# Phenotype Prediction using CUIs and Demographics

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of specific phenotypes (e.g., depression, obesity) based on Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) extracted from MIMIC-III Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and demographic data. Additionally, it evaluates model fairness across different demographic groups to identify potential biases.
